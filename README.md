# Hi

I'm Daniel Clouse.  I solve problems, generally with code, and I like helping 
people.  AI is getting a lot of attention these days, and while I can do that
stuff too, having a real, live, helpful human is important. I'm that guy.

## What

This page is mostly my musings, but it's also an attempt to understand what is 
happening and perhaps start a conversation.

## Why

Social media is very fast paced, but most important thought and discussion is 
done slowly, in the relative privacy of a community of - again - real, live
human beings.  I'm not a bot, and while I've written some, I don't want a 
conversation with, influenced by, or subject to bots.  So, no comments, no
retweets, but pull requests are welcome.

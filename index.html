                    I'm Daniel Clouse. I solve problems, generally with code, and I like helping 
                    people. AI is getting a lot of attention these days, and while I can do that
                    stuff too, having a real, live, helpful human is important. I'm that guy.

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>
                    This page is for collecting essays on technical topics.  There is no content 
                    management system, JS framework, CSS library.  It's just text.  But slow and 
                    long-form writing is good for me.  And hopefully for you too.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    Social media is very fast paced, but most important thought and discussion is 
                    done slowly, in the relative privacy of a community of - again - real, live
                    human beings. I'm not a bot, and while I've written some, I don't want a 
                    conversation with, influenced by, or subject to bots. So, no comments, no
                    retweets, but pull requests are welcome.

                I'm Daniel Clouse. I solve problems, generally with code, and I like helping 
                people. AI is getting a lot of attention these days, and while I can do that
                stuff too, having a real, live, helpful human is important. I'm that guy.

            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>
                This page is mostly my musings, but it's also an attempt to understand what is 
                happening and perhaps start a conversation.

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                Social media is very fast paced, but most important thought and discussion is 
                done slowly, in the relative privacy of a community of - again - real, live
                human beings. I'm not a bot, and while I've written some, I don't want a 
                conversation with, influenced by, or subject to bots. So, no comments, no
                retweets, but pull requests are welcome.
